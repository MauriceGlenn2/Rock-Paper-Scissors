# Rock-Paper-Scissors

# Rock, Paper, Scissors ‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è (Python Learning Project)

This project is part of my Python learning journey! In this exercise, I built a Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the computer and user make random choices, and the game determines who wins.

## üß† What I Learned

### ‚úÖ Lists Are Powerful
I learned how to use **lists to store multiple related items**, like the ASCII art for rock, paper, and scissors. This helped me **shorten my code** and keep it cleaner.

### ‚úÖ Simplifying with Numbers
Instead of repeating a lot of similar `if` statements, I learned I could **convert input choices to numbers** (like `1` for rock, `2` for paper, etc.), and **compare them using logic**. This reduces repetition and makes the code easier to maintain and expand.

## üéÆ How It Works

- The user selects Rock (1), Paper (2), or Scissors (3).
- The computer randomly chooses one of the options.
- The program compares both and prints who won.

cpu_choice = random.choice([rock, paper, scissors])
your_choice = input("Select 1 for rock, 2 for paper or 3 for scissors\n")
if your_choice == "1":
    print(rock)
    print("Computer chose: \n", cpu_choice)
    if cpu_choice == scissors:
        print("You Win!!!")
    elif cpu_choice == rock:
        print("Draw")
    else:
        print("You Lose!!")

elif your_choice == "2":
    print(paper)
    print("Computer chose: \n", cpu_choice)
    if cpu_choice == rock:
        print("You Win!!!")
    elif cpu_choice == paper:
        print("Draw")
    else:
        print("You Lose!!")

    print(scissors)
    print("Computer chose: \n", cpu_choice)
    if cpu_choice == paper:

    elif cpu_choice == scissors:
